## Background
 The aim is to replace the physical along with the remote procedures used during the preparation MCQs. The respective controls are not cost efficient rather expensive for the university. Other contributing factor include restricted user limitations such that it can be utilised proactively by the students on smartphones, tablets or computers across platforms (Android, iOS, web). Therefore, it will also be possible to offer a customised solution for teachers and professors, who would be able to send their questions directly to the students' devices and have a proactive interaction. This feature will be used during ongoing classes to allow teachers to verify whether the concepts shared are understood by the students by simply looking at the number of MCQs answered. The application would also display metrics (graph, charts) showing the number of answers associated with the different possible choices of the question. Thus, it would be more comprehensive for the teacher to measure the progress. On the contrary if the success rate of the question is not considered sufficient during the session, the teacher can reinforce the knowledge with new examples or by repeating the course. For the student, this application will allow him/her to analyse the key points that the teacher puts forward. They will be able to assess themselves in preparation for their exams while reviewing questions saved directly on their device and annotated by them during organised quizzes.
 
When revising with a group of students, a student can connect to the session via the QR Code or the session identifier generated by the application. The application also allows them to create their own questionnaire to review the concepts covered in class and thus work in a more interesting way while confronting each other in an interactive way.
Since the application is available in both French and English locale. The application has been developed by students of three different nationalities thus non-French speaking students will have no problem integrating along an English session to answer the different questions more easily.

It should also be noted that a version allowing accessibility to visually impaired students is under study so that all students can study equally and pass their exams successfully.
